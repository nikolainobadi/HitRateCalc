# HitRateCalc
HitRateCalc is an iOS app that helps players of the mobile game Final Fantasy Brave Exvius: War of the Visions determine the accuracy and evasion rates of their units. The app allows users to input dexterity, luck, and accuracy bonus values to calculate accuracy, and agility, luck, and evade bonus values to calculate evasion. The app then combines the two rates to display the final hitrate, or the chance of evading an attack. This app is a useful tool for players looking to optimize their unit's performance in battle.

## Architecure
HitRateCalc was build using SwiftUI (iOS 16 minimun deployment).
